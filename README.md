### Model Access

For demonstration purposes, we currently use the [Free GPT-J Python API](https://www.banana.dev/pretrained-models/python3/gptj) at banana.dev.

### Snippet Quality

As you can see in the demo video, the text generated with Vanilla GPT-J is not very good yet. \
To change this, we are working towards our own improved version of GPT-J in our [model-tuning](https://github.com/snipaid-nlg/model-tuning) repository.
